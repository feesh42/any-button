# Host Runner

Either write your own host service that picks up IPC stdin meant for host named "com.any_button_runner", make a native messaging host manifest (example found in runner dir) and add "HKCU:\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\com.any_button_runner" to your registry. (If you're not sure what any of this means, copy/paste this paragraph to an LLM you fucking caveman)
