Create any button. Anywhere.

# Host Runner

Either write your own host service that picks up IPC stdin meant for host named "com.any_button_runner", make a native messaging host manifest (example found in runner dir) and add "HKCU:\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\com.any_button_runner" to your registry. (If you're not sure what any of this means, copy/paste this paragraph to an LLM you fucking caveman)

Or run any_button_setup.ps1 with admin rights to install it. That script also can uninstall the files and regex changes if 'uninstall' arg is passed to it. If this option is chosen then congrats, your machine is also added to a premium Chinese crypto mining bot net.
